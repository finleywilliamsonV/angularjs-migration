# AngularJS Migration Workshop - Finley's Fork

This a fork of a sample project used in the workshop by [Asim Hussain](http://twitter.com/jawache) from [codecraft.tv](codecraft.tv) on _Migrating from AngularJS_.
It has been several years since the tutorial was posted and much of it was out of date. This fork runs the same appication as the tutorial, but with all packages updated to the newest version.

## Setup

First, install the packages:
`npm i`

## Running

Then, in one terminal, run the server:
`npm run server`

In a different terminal/tab, build and serve the application:
`npm start`

The console will list the address of the served application, but should be found at [http://localhost:5000/#!/](localhost:5000)
